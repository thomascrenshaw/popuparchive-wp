# Pop Up Archive WordPress Plugin

The Pop Up Archive WordPress Plugin is an alpha-phase project that helps us in our understanding of what our customers are looking for in the way of features. The plugin was built using our alpha-phase SDK and both will continue to evolve as Pop Up Archive evolves. We have a roadmap in mind but are always open to suggestions on features to add (or remove).
